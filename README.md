# COMPAS Analysis

The study of COMPAS Risk Scores for potential racial bias is imperative due to the profound impact these scores have on individuals' lives within the criminal justice system. Developed as a tool to aid judges in making informed decisions about pretrial release, sentencing, and parole, COMPAS utilizes algorithms that analyze various factors to predict an individual's likelihood of reoffending. However, concerns have arisen regarding the fairness and accuracy of these predictions, particularly in relation to race. Critics argue that historical biases within the criminal justice system, such as disproportionate arrest rates and sentencing disparities, may inadvertently influence the data used to train these algorithms. Consequently, there is a risk that COMPAS Risk Scores may perpetuate or even exacerbate existing racial disparities by potentially unfairly labeling certain racial groups as higher risk. Understanding and addressing any racial bias in COMPAS is essential to promoting fairness, equity, and transparency in the criminal justice system, ensuring that decisions are based on accurate and unbiased assessments rather than perpetuating systemic injustices. Therefore, rigorous study and scrutiny of COMPAS Risk Scores are essential to ensure that they fulfill their intended purpose without unfairly discriminating against any particular group based on race or ethnicity.

The notebook aims to explore whether COMPAS Risk Scores show any unfairness based on race. It will analyze the different factors that COMPAS considers when assigning risk scores to individuals. By looking closely at the data and using statistical methods, the goal is to find out if there's any indication that COMPAS treats people unfairly based on their race. This analysis is part of an effort to make the criminal justice system more transparent and fair. The analysis also encourages open discussion and understanding about how algorithms like COMPAS might impact people differently. This exploration was made to contribute to ongoing conversations about fairness and accountability in the criminal justice system.
